# WitnessChain API Tutorials

Welcome to the official repository of WitnessChain API tutorials! This collection of guides and examples is designed to help developers build powerful community-driven witnessing campaigns using our platform.

## What is WitnessChain?
WitnessChain provides APIs that empower builders to create engagement campaigns where community members witness and verify real-world events through our InfinityWatch mobile app. The mobile app runs a location watchtower underneath which participates in decentralized proof-of-location challenges to validate the location claims. By connecting event organizers with on-the-ground participants, our platform enables transparent, reliable documentation of what's happening in the world.

## Available Tutorials

This repository contains comprehensive tutorials for all WitnessChain APIs:

- **Campaign API** - As builders, design and launch witnessing campaigns with custom parameters
